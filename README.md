# Jon Jelinek's public website

Welcome to my public website. 

This site is a TiddlyWiki. [TiddlyWiki's](https://tiddlywiki.com/) are unique ways to organize ideas.

I have long been inspired by the Zettelkasten method of note-taking, and this variety of TiddlyWiki is customized to use many of those techniques. For more information, check out the [tzk](https://github.com/sobjornstad/tzk) project.
